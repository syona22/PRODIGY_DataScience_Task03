# PRODIGY_DataScience_Task03
# The dataset of bank consists of 17 columns and 45211 rows. It is a mix of categorical variables and numerical variables.
# The dataset consists of columns 'age', 'job', 'marital', 'education', 'default', 'balance', 'housing', 'loan', 'contact', 'day', 'month', 'duration', 'campaign', 'pdays', 'previous', 'poutcome', 'deposit'. These columns collectively provide a range of demographic, financial, temporal, and historical behavioral data that can be leveraged to predict customer behavior and preferences regarding purchasing decisions.
# The data is imported and is inspected. The information is extracted to see the datatypes and column names. The data is then cleaned by checking if there are null values and also visualising it. The dataset is split into features (X) and the target variable (y), then further split it into training and testing sets. We initialized a decision tree classifier and trained it on the training data. Predictions were made on the test data, evaluated the model's performance using accuracy, a classification report, and a confusion matrix. Finally, visualization of the decision tree using Matplotlib was projected to gain insights into how the model makes decisions.
